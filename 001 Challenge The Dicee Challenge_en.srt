1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,260
Right. So now that we've seen how we can select and manipulate elements in our web site on the fly using

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,540
this great thing called the DOM, then it's time to take it to the next level.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,770
We're going to be using all of that knowledge that we learned about the DOM and Javascript to create our

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,460
very own dice game.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,110
And this is what it will look like once we're done.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,870
So it's a paint with a h1 with a title that says Refresh Me, and then it's got Player 1 dice and

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,150
Player 2 dice.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,830
And when we refresh our web site then our dice get thrown randomly,

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,830
so that player 1 and player 2

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,300
both have their own dice values, and our web site will announce a winner depending on whose dice value

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,610
was higher.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,260
So you can see that this will be a really neat web site and you can use this web site to settle all

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,410
your family arguments and any sort of disputes just by logging on to your own web site and trying to

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,150
figure out who won.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,510
So it's a really quick and simple web site

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,670
that I want you to create by yourself as a challenge, and this is so that you make all of that knowledge

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,030
that you picked up in the previous lessons and make it your own by applying it on a real world project.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,760
So in the next lesson you'll find the starting code with the HTML and CSS already written for you,

19
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,800
and this is so that you can get started practicing the parts that we learned in this module.

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,950
Now if you'd prefer to get extra practice by building the HTML and CSS parts from scratch yourself,

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,970
then you can. Just simply download the skeleton project and open up Dicee.html in order to see it

22
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,500
inside the Chrome browser,

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,500
and based on this appearance you can write your own HTML and CSS to get it to look the same. And you'll

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,470
find all of the image assets inside that zip file that you're going to be downloading.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,330
So I personally recommend to focus on one new thing at a time,

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,510
so that's why we provided the skeleton project, so you can focus on what we're learning in this module,

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,410
but it's completely up to you what you want to do.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,310
I'll support you every step of the way.

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:11,100
So once you're ready get started and work on your first web site that you're going to build all by yourself

30
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,320
and I'll see you on the other side.
